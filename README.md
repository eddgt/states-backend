# Backend API for States and Counties

This is a backend API developed with Node.js 18.13.0 and TypeScript that provides endpoints for retrieving information about states and counties.

Sure, here's how you can add the section for creating SQL tables to your README:

## SQL Tables

This API uses a PostgreSQL database to store information about states and counties. Below are the SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

### States Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE states (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    population INT NOT NULL,
    counties INT NOT NULL
);
```

### Counties Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE counties (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    population INT NOT NULL,
    state_id INT REFERENCES states(id)
);
```

These SQL commands will create the `states` and `counties` tables with the required columns. You can execute these commands in your PostgreSQL database management tool or by running SQL scripts.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eddgt/states-backend.git
```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd states-backend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file at the root of the project and providing the necessary values for your local database. You can find an example of the required variables in the `.env.example` file.

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3003/api/states to test the app

## Usage

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/states`: Get a list of all states.
- `GET /api/states/:id`: Get details of a specific state by its ID.
- `GET /api/counties`: Get a list of all counties.
- `GET /api/counties/:id`: Get details of a specific county by its ID.

To use the endpoints, make HTTP requests to the corresponding URL using your favorite HTTP client or tools like cURL or Postman.


## Dockerfile
### Create de Docker image
Building the Docker image: Open a terminal in the directory where your Dockerfile is located and execute the following command to build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t image_name .
```

### Running the Docker container
Running the Docker container: Once the Docker image has been successfully built, you can run a container based on that image using the following command:

```
docker run -p 3003:3003 image_name
```
